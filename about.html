  <h2 id="about">About Us</h2>
  <p>Turning the time machine back to nursery days, one sees a tiny seed of an institution germinating, taking root
    and
    blossoming into a full-grown verdure plant. Completing 20 years in 2014, as it steps into its mature years, one
    finds it branching out in all spheres of holistic development of an individual, taking pride in providing socially
    relevant and innovative curriculum, out-of-the-box ideating platform for growth, and youthful energy to its
    students
    and faculty. Running 10 undergraduate programmes in all the three important streams: Arts, Commerce and Sciences,
    it
    nurtures interdisciplinarity and competency exchanges in the form of inter departmental research and outreach
    programmes.

    <b id="quote">'Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I Learn.' </b>These words seem to be
    the echo
    that
    resounds in every page of MAC. The veracity of this saying is nowhere better illustrated than in the classrooms of
    MAC because they are learner-centric. The thrust has always been on two-way communication: a process of building
    partnerships between the learner and the learned. It can be said that learning is no longer sacrosanct to be
    monasticated in a sanctuary of classrooms and library. It spills over in the lawns, on the stage and in
    playgrounds.
    In fact MAC can boast of 'classrooms without walls' as learning happens on field-based innovative research
    projects,
    adoption of villages such as Baroji and educational trips. Participation of the students in the extension
    activities
    of the college with vigour and enthusiasm has led to strong bonds between the residents of Baroji in Mewat
    District
    of Haryana; and the experiential Learning through The Leadership Development Program, an initiative of the NSS in
    the college has helped students work towards the upliftment of localities in the vicinity.
